- 👋 Hi, I’m Alexander Bogatskiy, I am a postdoc at the Flatiron Institute (part of the Simons Foundation) in NYC.
- 👀 I’m interested in physics-informed machine learning methods, especially equivariant architectures with applications in high energy physics, chemistry, etc.
<!-- - 🌱 I’m currently learning  -->
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any applications that would fundamentally benefit from symmetry-constrained architecture designs.
- 📫 How to reach me: my GitHub username @flatironinstitute.org
