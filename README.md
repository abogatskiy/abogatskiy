- 👋 Hi, I’m Alexander Bogatskiy, I am a postdoc at the Data Science Institute (University of Chicago) in Chicago.
- 👀 I’m interested in physics-informed machine learning methods, especially equivariant architectures with applications in high energy physics, chemistry, etc.
<!-- - 🌱 I’m currently learning  -->
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any applications that would fundamentally benefit from symmetry-constrained architecture designs.
- 📫 How to reach me by email: a_bogatskiy followed by the uchicago domain.
